I was an avid quizzer in my school days. Even today, I enjoy a good science and/or history quiz. Sometimes, people are kind enough to ask me to host some quiz; or I volunteer to do them myself.

Below, I will upload some of the quiz sets that I have prepared.

[Cerebrum, 2019: The Tezpur University Open Science Quiz](/quiz/Cerebrum_2019.pdf) (prelims is quite easy, but the finals might give you some food for thought)

[Cerebrum Redux: Adda Quiz via Zoom](/quiz/Cerebrum_Redux_Web.pdf) (questions are deliberately vague to inhibit cheating, since this was an online quiz via Zoom)

[The Science Quiz of the Tezpur Quiz Association's Annual Quiz Fest 2023](/quiz/Full_Quiz.pdf) (My friend Dr. Salik M.Borbora ran this set as I was unable to attend the quiz, all questions are mine)
