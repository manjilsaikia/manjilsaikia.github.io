Starting from August 2014, I have decided to keep a record of the books that I have read or am currently reading. This list is just for my recollection, but once in a while if I find the book very appealing I may post a review somewhere.

Below I list all the fiction books I have read since August 2024 (in reverse chronological order). For all books, please refer to this [page](/books/). 

The books that are marked with a ** are the ones that I am either currently reading or have not read completely but plan to do so in the future.

>All the books that I read are rated on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36494310-manjil).
