# Information

**Organizers**: Manjil Saikia & Pravakar Paul

**Lecture Time & Place**: to be decided via email

# Seminar Details

We will study papers in algebraic combinatorics (with applications to other areas such as topology, geometry, etc.) of contemporary interest. Each of the organizers shall alternate giving lectures based on one paper each.
