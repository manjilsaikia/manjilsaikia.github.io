# Information

**Instructor**: Dr Manjil P. Saikia

**Contact**: manjil.saikia@ahduni.edu.in (please only use this email address to send me emails related to this course)

**Lecture Time & Place**: Wednesdays & Fridays 1100 to 1215 (Room XXX, SAS)

**Office Hours**: XXX

**Attendance Policy**: Attendance is mandatory, check the institute's attendance policy on AURIS (please note, we have a new policy from last semester). If you are low on attendance then you should talk to me (at least 3 weeks before the end-semester examination).

# Course Details

Available on AURIS, we will follow the syllabus (more or less), but *there will be a few digressions*. So, I encourage you to keep notes.

# Reading Materials

There is no fixed textbook for this course. I will try to provide the materials to be discussed before each lecture. Students are expected to read up on the shared material.

# Grading

- **Assignments**: Regular homework assignments will be given, which will count towards 20% of the total score. Approximately one assignment will be given for every 3 lecture sessions. At least some of them will use WebWork (details about this will be shared via email).
- **Quiz**: There will be two 20-minute quizzes, which will count towards 20% of the total score.
- **Project**: A group project will be assigned to students in groups of 2 - 3 students; they will have to submit a written report. This will count towards 10% of the total score.
- **Presentation**: A presentation on the project component above will have to be made by the students. This will count towards 10% of the total score.
- **Mid-Semester Examination**: We will have a 60-minute written exam (closed book), this will count towards 20% of the total score.
- **End-Semester Examination**: We will have a 120-minute written exam (with one cheat sheet allowed), this will count towards 20% of the total score.

*To get an A grade, you must score atleast 80% overall. However, this doesn't automatically guarantee an A.*

# Lectures

W 04/08: Introduction to the course, historical overview of number theory & cryptography

# Assignments

- The problem set will be updated over the semester. I will announce this in class when I post a set here.
- To get the most out of this course, you are expected to spend at least twice the amount of lecture hours on your own.

## Submissions

- Due time: 11:59 am of each due date
- Must be submitted as PDF (via email) or printed/written (slide under my office door)
- Begin each solution on a new page, and use only blank or dotted pages (not ruled)
- Staple the submission, if submitting a paper version
- State your sources at the top of each problem (even if you worked independently)

## Late Policy

- **Penalty**: Late submissions will be penalized by 25% per each late day
- **Extensions**: There will be no extensions given

## Collaborations

- You are encouraged to first work on the problems independently before seeking collaboration.
- Meaningful collaboration is allowed and is encouraged for this course.
- You must write up your solutions.

## Acknowledging collaborators and sources

It is required to acknowledge your sources (even if you worked independently).

- At the beginning of the submission for each problem, write Collaborators and sources: followed by a list of collaborators and sources consulted (people, books, papers, websites, software, etc.), or write none if you did not use any such resources.
- Failure to acknowledge will result in an automatic 20% penalty per problem.
- Acceptable uses of resources include: looking up a standard theorem/formula/technique; using Wolfram Alpha/Mathematica/Python for a calculation (no need to mention lectures)
- Unacceptable uses of resources include: directly looking up the problem online or in the research literature for a solution. (Once you have solved a problem, it is fine to seek and learn alternate solutions.)

Intentional violations of the above policies may be considered academic dishonesty/misconduct.

(Thanks to [Professor Yufei Zhao](https://yufeizhao.com) for his extensive course policy page, from which I have created my policies.)
