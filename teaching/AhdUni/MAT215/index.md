# Information

**Instructor**: Dr Manjil P. Saikia

**Contact**: manjil.saikia@ahduni.edu.in (please only use this email address to send me emails related to this course)

**Lecture Time & Place**: Mondays & Fridays 1430 to 1545 (Room XXX, SAS)

**Office Hours**: XXX

**Attendance Policy**: Attendance is mandatory, check the institute's attendance policy on AURIS (please note, we have a new policy from last semester). If you are low on attendance then you should talk to me (at least 3 weeks before the end-semester examination).

# Course Details

Available on AURIS, we will follow the syllabus more or less, but *there will be a few digressions*.

# Reading Materials

**Textbook**: The textbook that I will use is **Algebraic Combinatorics and Coinvariant Spaces** by *Francois Bergeron* (CRC Press, 2019). There is also a course pack which will be distributed to the registered students, containing some other materials taken from standard textbooks. In addition, I will use material from other sources which I will list below as the course progresses.

# Grading

There will be regular problem sets assigned, which will contribute 60% of the total score. The problem sheets will be shared below. The end-semester examination will be a 3 3-hour long written exam which will contribute 40% to the total score.

Grades of A and A- will be awarded based on the discretion of the instructor. If you solve all problems in the assignments and participate in the class then your grades will positively reflect that.

# Lectures

W 04/08: Introduction to the course, historical overview of number theory & cryptography

# Problem Sets

- The problem set will be updated over the semester. I will announce this in class when I post a set here.
- You should only submit the designated problem(s) but are encouraged to try the rest as well.
- To get the most out of this course, you are expected to spend at least twice the amount of lecture hours on your own.

## Submissions

- Due time: 11:59 pm of each due date
- Must be typed in LaTeX and submitted as PDF or printed
- Begin each solution on a new page
- State your sources at the top of each problem (even if you worked independently)

## Late Policy

- **Penalty**: Late submissions will be penalized by 20% per each late day
- **Extensions**: There will be no extensions given (unless you have a medical leave approved for the day before the due date and the day of the due date)

## Collaborations

- You are encouraged to first work on the problems independently before seeking collaboration.
- Meaningful collaboration is allowed and is encouraged for this course.
- You must write up your solutions.

## Acknowledging collaborators and sources

It is required to acknowledge your sources (even if you worked independently).

- At the beginning of the submission for each problem, write Collaborators and sources: followed by a list of collaborators and sources consulted (people, books, papers, websites, software, etc.), or write none if you did not use any such resources.
- Failure to acknowledge will result in an automatic 20% penalty per problem.
- Acceptable uses of resources include: looking up a standard theorem/formula/technique; using Wolfram Alpha/Mathematica/Python for a calculation (no need to mention lectures or book draft)
- Unacceptable uses of resources include: directly looking up the problem online or in the research literature for a solution. (Once you have solved a problem, it is fine to seek and learn alternate solutions.)

Intentional violations of the above policies may be considered academic dishonesty/misconduct.

(Thanks to [Professor Yufei Zhao](https://yufeizhao.com) for his extensive course policy page, from which I have created my policies.)
